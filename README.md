## User Design

### Strategy
* With the main goal for this website to educate users into being aware of what you can do in Lanzarote the use of simple, 
  aesthetically pleasing and relevant imagery will allow the user to focus on the content, without being distracted. 
  The design of the site needs to complement the content it is delivering. 
* The contact form allows customers to engage further with the Go Lanza company, it ensures that any further information needed can be requested. 
  To ensure this happens, the website needs to be engaging with an suitable user experience to keep the visitor on the site.
* This website is aimed at users who want to be aware of the experiences Lanzarote has to offer. 
  There is no pressure to pursue these attractions. Moreover, there are different types of attractions to suit different types of potential users. T
  he main attractions that Lanzarote is famous for, the lesser-known attractions which might suit users looking for a more subtle experience and the restaurants that can be visited for anyone who wants to prioritise enjoying highly rated food.

### Scope

* Body - 
    * Main elements found here, depicting important information, relavant to the current page user is on.
    * There will be button elements that enable the user to navigate the content easily and simply.
    * Dependent on the page, there will be images with accompanying information for the user to discover.
* Footer - 
    * Footer section will hold any links to social media accounts

### Design

#### Color Scheme
* The color of the scheme of the site was decided by using natural warm colors that can be easily associated with a sunny destination such as Lanzarote.
* The color of #e35c27, complements the main and overall color dervived from the backfround image. 
* Where suitable the color black was used for text against a white background, these are contrasting colors that allow the user to easily read the information.
* With a neutral background color, the images used would not be too contrasting on the site when loaded.  

#### Typography
* Two fonts were used throughout this website. Font utilised for the logo and headings is Londrina. The second font utilised was the Montserrat font. Both of these fonts are of the serif typeface, therefore Sans Serif will be used as the fallback font in case there is an issue when importing the fonts, or browsers not supporting these. 
  These fonts were imported via Google Fonts and both completement each other giving a visually pleasing user experience.

#### Imagery
* Images of the attractions were of vital importance as it needed to showcase the attractions highlighted by the website. 
* Font icons will be used throughout the website imported from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
  These will be used to further emphasise the different sections of the website. 
  Using these icons adds a simple, effective and a subtle touch to the site that allows the user to understand what each section relates to. 
  The icons will be relevant to the different section headings of the site.
